## Current Status
Setting up the collaborative AI workflow — the scaffold itself is the first project.

## What We've Built So Far
- GitHub repo live at `kakho0422-ai/cowork-scaffold`
- Project structure: `reasoning/`, `states/`, `figma/`, `docs/`
- Notion connected and mirroring plan
- Named workflow processes (see below)

## What's Next
- Decide on first real project to build
- Update `states/ken.md` at the end of each session (Levelling Up)
- Build the end-of-session routine into a habit

## Process Names
| Process | Name |
|---------|------|
| I edit files, Ken pushes to GitHub | The Loop |
| Writing a reasoning entry | Laying a Breadcrumb |
| Updating ken.md after learning something | Levelling Up |
| Updating chloe.md when capabilities change | Syncing Chloe |
| Giving another AI the GitHub URL | The Handoff |
| Reading state files at start of session | Reading the Room |
| Pushing plan to GitHub + mirroring to Notion | Closing the Session |
