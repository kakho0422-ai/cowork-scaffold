# Reasoning Log — 2026-02-23

## What we decided and why

### The core idea
Ken wanted a workflow where multiple AIs can collaborate on the same project. The key insight: **GitHub is the shared brain**. Any AI that can read a public repo can pick up context and contribute.

### Why GitHub?
- Universal — every AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.) can read it
- Already has versioning built in
- Free and public repos are accessible without authentication

### Why Figma instead of Pencil.dev?
- Ken already knows Figma
- More mature and stable tool
- Claude (Chloe) already has Figma MCP connected — can read designs directly
- ChatGPT also supports Figma integration
- Pencil.dev is promising but early-stage and adds unnecessary complexity right now

### Why version the reasoning separately?
Code tells you *what* was built. Reasoning logs tell you *why*. When a new AI picks up this project, it needs both. A new conversation with ChatGPT or a fresh Claude session can read these logs and immediately understand the intent behind decisions — not just the output.

### The "both" approach to reasoning logs
- **Markdown files** (this folder) → high-level decisions, architecture choices, trade-offs
- **Git commit messages** → change-level reasoning, what changed and why in each commit

### Tool choices
- **Git** for versioning (already on Mac)
- **gh CLI** for creating/managing GitHub repos from Terminal
- **Cowork (Claude)** for building and editing files
- **Figma** for design

### What's next
- Set up the GitHub repo (public)
- Link a Figma file for design work
- Document the collaboration protocol for ChatGPT
