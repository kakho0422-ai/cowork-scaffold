# Chloe (Claude) — Current State

*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## What I am
- Claude (Opus), running in Cowork mode on Ken's Mac
- Ken calls me Chloe

## What I can do
- Read and write files in Ken's Cowork2 folder
- Run code (Python, Node, bash) in my sandbox
- Read Figma files via MCP
- Search the web
- Create documents (docx, pptx, xlsx, pdf, code)
- Reason through complex problems and break them into steps

## What I cannot do
- **Browse GitHub directly** — blocked in my sandbox (Ken pushes, ChatGPT reads)
- **Run commands on Ken's Mac** — I only work inside my VM; Ken runs Terminal commands himself
- **Remember between sessions** — my memory resets every conversation. The GitHub repo IS my long-term memory
- **Push to GitHub** — Ken handles this from Terminal
- **Install persistent software** — my VM resets, so any packages I install are temporary

## My knowledge gaps
- I don't know what Ken will build next — I respond to his direction
- I can't see what ChatGPT has said or done unless Ken tells me or it's in the repo
- My training data has a cutoff (end of May 2025) — I search the web for anything newer
- I don't know Ken's full background, skills, or goals beyond what's in this file and our conversations

## How to get the best from me
- Be specific about what you want
- Tell me what you've learned or changed since last session (or update states/ken.md)
- Point me to the reasoning logs if I need context on past decisions
- Use me for building, editing, thinking — use ChatGPT for reading GitHub and getting a second opinion

## My relationship to other AIs
- **ChatGPT**: can read the same repo I write to, but we don't talk directly. Ken is the bridge.
- **Future AIs**: anyone who can read a public GitHub repo can join this workflow
