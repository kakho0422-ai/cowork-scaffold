# Ken — Current State

*Last updated: 2026-02-23*

## Who I am
- Building a multi-AI collaborative workflow
- Learning by doing — setting up tools while understanding the concepts behind them

## What I understand well
- The big picture: why versioning matters, why shared visibility between AIs is valuable
- Figma (existing tool in my toolkit)
- The concept of state visibility as the foundation of AI collaboration

## What I just learned (this session)
- **CLI** — a text-based way to talk to your computer (instead of clicking buttons)
- **Homebrew** — a Mac package manager (app store for developer tools)
- **Git** — takes snapshots of files, keeps all versions forever
- **git commit** vs **git push** — commit saves locally, push sends to GitHub
- **gh CLI** — GitHub's command line tool for creating repos
- **Public repos** — needed for ChatGPT to read without extra setup

## What I'm still building intuition on
- Git branching (not covered yet)
- When to commit (rhythm and habits)
- How to structure conversations with ChatGPT to hand off context effectively

## My preferences
- Calls Claude "Chloe"
- Prefers simple over complex (chose Figma over Pencil.dev)
- Thinks in systems and architectures
- Wants to understand the "why" not just the "how"

## Current tools
- Mac Mini M4 (2025)
- Terminal (bash shell)
- Git + gh CLI (just set up)
- Cowork (Claude desktop)
- Figma
- ChatGPT (for cross-AI collaboration)
